Customizing Eclipse to be as close as possible to IntelliJ IDEA

As I started a new project in a regulated environment I was forced to move to Eclipse, since this was the accepted IDE. Up to now I was using solely IntelliJ IDEA, which is probably the best IDE nowadays. With a little customization we can setup Eclipse to look like IDEA and also behave more or less like IDEA. I still have a problem with key mappings but the look&feel is almost perfect.
